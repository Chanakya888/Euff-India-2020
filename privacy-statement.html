                    <p class="margin-top-20">You have the right of access to your personal data and the right to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data. The right of rectification can only apply to factual data processed. Individuals registering to events online can also update, delete their data or unsubscribe online.

                    <h3>7. LEGAL BASIS</h3>
                    <h4> On what grounds we collect your data?</h4>
                    <p class="margin-top-20">The processing of personal data related to the European Union Film Festival organised by the EU Delegation to India is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest [Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725], as mandated by the Treaties, in particular by articles 5, 11, 20, 21-40, 42, 43 of the of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and 2 (4) and (5), 205, 220-221, 326 – 334 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).</p>
                    <p><strong>Further reference:</strong></p>
                    <p>Council Decision of 26 July 2010 establishing the organisation and functioning of the EEAS (2010/427/EU) (OJ L 201, 3/8/2010, p. 30) and Shared Vision, Common Action: A Stronger Europe - A Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign and Security Policy  of June 2016 and  Council Conclusions of October 2016 where the Council of the European Union emphasises <em>"the need of joining up efforts in the field of public diplomacy including strategic communication, inside and outside the EU, to speak with one voice and ultimately promote its core values”.</em></p>
                    <p>Your consent is required for the inclusion of your data in a permanent contact list shared internally among EEAS services for the purpose of promoting future EU activities/events and disseminating information. You can withdraw your consent at any time and you also have the option not to give consent.</p>

                <div class="privacy-policy">
                    <h3>8. TIME LIMIT - DATA STORING</h3>
                    <h4>For what period and how we process your data?</h4>
                    <p class="margin-top-20">Our aim is to keep your personal data not longer than necessary for the purposes we collect them. After the conclusion of the European Union Film Festival, your data are kept as long as follow-up actions to the European Union Film Festival are required. Reports and other material containing personal data are archived according to e-Domec policy. </p>
                    <p>Personal data will be deleted five years after the last action in relation to the European Union Film Festival. Personal data may, however, be part of a contact list shared internally among EEAS services for the purpose of promoting future EU activities and disseminating information. The privacy statement on public diplomacy initiatives is also available on the EEAS website. Financial data related to the European Union Film Festival will be kept for a maximum period of 10 years after the end of the event or meeting for auditing purposes. Personal data may be kept for information and historical, statistical or scientific purposes for a longer period of time including the publication on the EU Delegation to India website and social media handles, EEAS Intranet or EEAS website with appropriate safeguards in place.</p>
                    <h4><u>Security of data</u></h4>
                    <p>The EEAS and the EU Delegation to India strive to ensure a high level of security for your personal data. Appropriate organisational and technical measures are ensured according to Article 33 of Reg. (EU) 2018/1725. The collected personal data are stored on servers that abide by pertinent security rules. Data is processed by assigned staff members. Files have authorised access. Measures are provided to prevent unauthorised entities from access, alteration, deletion, disclosure of data. General access to personal data is only possible to recipients with a UserID/Password. Physical copies are stored in a secured manner. In case a service provider is contracted, as a processor, the collected data may be stored electronically by the external contractor, who has to guarantee data protection and confidentiality required by the Reg. (EU) 2018/1725. These measures also provide a high level of assurance for the confidentiality and integrity of the communication between you [your browser] and the EEAS/EU Delegation to India. Nevertheless, a residual risk always exists for communication over the internet, including email exchange. The EEAS relies on services provided by other EU institutions, primarily the European Commission, to support the security and performance of the EEAS website.</p>
